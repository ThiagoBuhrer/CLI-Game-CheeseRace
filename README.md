## **Project Summary**
This CLI game was created to showcase object-oriented programming concepts through interactive gameplay in the console. 
It demonstrates class design, inheritance, and encapsulation while providing a simple, engaging user experience. 
The entire project was developed in **Java**.

---

## **How to start the game?**
1. Clone this repository and open the project (you may use Visual Studio Code or a Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA).  
2. Find the file **`Main.java`** located in: Cheese_Race > src > CheeseRace > GamePlay.
3. Run the **`Main`** class to start the game.  
It runs directly in the console, where you can interact by typing commands and reading the text output.

## **Plot**
Deep in the Sewer Worldâ€™s shadows, youâ€™re thrust into a ruthless race for glory. Guided by sly rat hustlers Bobbie and Jimmy, you must shatter records, earn cheese currency, and upgrade your ride at Mozzaratoâ€™s gritty garage. Each lap pushes you closer to the edge. Only those who master all four challenges can carve their names into Sewer World legend.

## **Rules and Final Goal**
- Rat pilots may choose **_Vehicles_** (either **_Cars_** or **_Motorcycles_**), **_Items_** and **_Tracks_** they want to ride.  
- There are **09 different Tracks** available. Each one has **02 _Moments_ â›”** associated with it.  
- **_Moments_ â›”** have attributes that cause delays for a **_Vehicle_** at certain points on a track.  
- Some **_Moments_** favor **lighter vehicles**, others favor **more powerful vehicles**.  
- Be mindful when choosing the **_Tracks_**, considering your current **_Vehicle_** and special **_Items_** attached.  
- Whenever you **beat the current record** of any **_Track_**, you will be awarded **Cheese Pieces ðŸ§€**.  
- **Cheese Pieces ðŸ§€** can be exchanged for **_Items_** and **_Vehicles_** at the mechanic shop.  
- Your final goal: beat the record of 04 different Tracks and become the greatest rat pilot in the **Sewer World**.
